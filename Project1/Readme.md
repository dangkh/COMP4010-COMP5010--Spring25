# COMP4010/5120: Data Visualization - Spring 2025

# Instruction for Project 1

## 1. Project Details

The goal of this project is to apply what you have learned throughout the semester to solve a real-world problem. Students will be assigned in teams of three members per team.

In this project, you will be given a list of datasets and your team will pick the one that interests you the most. The project will be completed over the first half of the semester and will account for 20% of your final score.

## 2. Project Timeline

- **Week 1 (12/03 - 18/03):** Discuss with your team to choose a suitable dataset and write your proposal.
- **Week 2 (19/03 - 25/03):** Provide peer reviews to two other teams as issues on their GitHub repos. Address issues raised on your teamâ€™s project repo through explicit commits. Start working on coding, presentation, and report.
- **Week 3 (26/03 - 31/03):** Review feedback from the teaching team on your proposal and continue working on deliverables.
- **Week 4 (01/04 - 10/04):** Finalize your report and presentation, and clean up code files.

## 3. Deadlines

There are four important milestones for this project:

- **18/03:** Submit the first version of the project proposal.
- **25/03:** Complete peer reviews for two other teams.
- **31/03:** Resubmit the revised proposal based on peer reviews and resolve the issues raised.
- **10/04:** Submit the project package, including presentation slides, write-up, and code files.

## 4. Deliverables

### 4.1 Project Questions

The project is open-ended. The first step is selecting a dataset from the [TidyTuesday](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday) project repository. The dataset must meet these requirements:

- Published after 2023.
- Contains both numerical and categorical variables.

After selecting the dataset, you need to formulate two questions for analysis:

- Each question should involve at least three variables.
- The two questions should not use a completely overlapping set of variables.

### 4.2 Details on Deliverables

#### **ðŸ“ŒProposal - Due 18th of March**

Your proposal should include:

- A brief description of your dataset, including its provenance and dimensions.
- The reason for choosing the dataset.
- The two questions you want to answer.
- A plan for answering each question, including the involved variables and any external data to be merged.

ðŸ‘‰*Expected output:*

- Create a public repository on GitHub.
- Upload your proposal and data to the repository (proposal can be a .md file).
- Submit the repository link on Canvas.

#### **ðŸ“ŒPeer Review - Due 25th of March**

Each team will review the proposals of two other teams. We will assign review pairs (see Section 6.3 of this document).

**Review Process:**

- Develop the review as a team.
- One member will submit it as an issue on the reviewed teamâ€™s project repo.
- Title the issue: `Peer review for proposal - [Your group name]`.
- Provide 2-3 constructive suggestions.

ðŸ‘‰*Expected output:*

- Create two issues on the repositories of the teams assigned to you.
- Submit links to the issues on Canvas.

#### **ðŸ“ŒRevised Proposal - Due 31st of March**

After receiving feedback, update your proposal and make necessary revisions.

ðŸ‘‰*Expected output:*

- Commits and comments addressing the issues raised.
- Submit the final version of the proposal on Canvas (PDF format).
- Submit links to addressed issues on your repository.

#### **ðŸ“ŒWrite-up - Due 10th of April**

The write-up consists of three parts:

1. **Introduction:** Briefly introduce the dataset and its importance.
2. **Question 1 Analysis:**
   - Introduction to the question and relevant dataset components.
   - Approach: Describe types of plots (boxplot, barplot, etc.) and their relevance.
   - Analysis: Code snippets and visualizations.
   - Discussion: Interpretation of results.
3. **Question 2 Analysis:** Same structure as Question 1.
4. **Conclusion:** Summary of findings and next steps.

ðŸ‘‰*Expected output:*

- Submit the report on Canvas in Jupyter Notebook and PDF format.
- Ensure the report is well-documented and reproducible.

#### **ðŸ“ŒPresentation - Slides Due 10th of April, Oral Presentation in the Following Week**

Each team will give an **8-minute presentation**, followed by **Q&A**. The session will last **15 minutes** in total.

ðŸ‘‰*Expected output:*
