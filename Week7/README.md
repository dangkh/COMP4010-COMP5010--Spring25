Minard’s map (English translation). Full size image: [Wikipedia](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Minard_Update.png).

Charles Joseph Minard's map depicting Napoleon's Russian campaign of 1812 is not just a remarkable piece of historical cartography but also a seminal work in the field of data visualization. Completed in 1869, this map is often hailed as one of the most powerful and insightful visualizations of data ever created.

Minard, a French civil engineer, masterfully combined several data sets into a single two-dimensional image. His map portrays the size of Napoleon's army, the path of the campaign, the direction of travel, and the temperature at various stages of the retreat from Moscow. The width of the tan and black band illustrates the size of the army at each point along the route, dramatically shrinking as the troops faced harsh temperatures, combat losses, and other hardships.

The impact and importance of Minard's map in the realm of data visualization are profound:

1. **Multivariate Representation**: Minard's map was groundbreaking in its ability to represent multiple variables—geography, army size, direction, and temperature—simultaneously in a clear, coherent manner. This was a significant step forward in the art and science of data visualization.
2. **Narrative Power**: The map tells a compelling story, not just presenting data but also conveying the disastrous scale of the campaign. It serves as an early and powerful example of how visual data can communicate complex stories, making them accessible and engaging to a wide audience.
3. **Pioneering Information Design**: Minard's work is seen as a precursor to modern infographics and data journalism. It demonstrated how statistical data could be integrated with graphic design to produce a clear, succinct, and visually engaging representation of complex information.
4. **Influence on Subsequent Work**: The map has been extensively studied and praised for its clarity and effectiveness, influencing generations of data scientists, statisticians, and designers. It stands as a benchmark for effective data visualization, often used in education to demonstrate best practices.
5. **Evolving Relevance**: In an age where data is more abundant and complex than ever, Minard's map remains relevant. It is a testament to the enduring power of well-crafted visualizations to make sense of large, complex data sets.

In summary, Minard's map goes beyond the mere tracing of Napoleon's army; it encapsulates a tragic episode in history through a masterful blend of art, science, and storytelling. Its legacy lies in its enduring influence on how we visualize and interpret data, making it a cornerstone in the field of data visualization.

## 2. Introduction to R

### 2.1. Overview of R

R is a powerful language and environment for statistical computing and graphics. It is highly extensible and offers a wide variety of statistical and graphical techniques, including linear and nonlinear modeling, statistical tests, time series analysis, classification, clustering, and more. R is open source and freely available, making it a popular choice in academia, research, and industry for data analysis and visualization tasks.

R is particularly noted for its rich ecosystem of packages, especially for data visualization (like ggplot2), and its vibrant community. Its integrated suite of software facilities makes it easy to manipulate data, perform calculations, and display the results graphically.

To install R and RStudio, follow the instructions here:

[https://rstudio-education.github.io/hopr/starting.html](https://rstudio-education.github.io/hopr/starting.html)

### 2.2. R and Python: Comparing and Contrasting

While Python is a general-purpose language with strong capabilities in data analysis and visualization, R is a specialized language for statistical analysis. Here are some key comparisons:

- **Purpose**: Python is versatile, used for web development, automation, and data science, while R is specifically designed for data analysis and statistical computing.
- **Libraries**: Both have extensive libraries for data analysis. Python has Pandas, NumPy, and Matplotlib, while R has `dplyr`, `tidyr`, and `ggplot2`.
- **Syntax**: Python is known for its readability and ease of use. R, while having a steeper learning curve, offers advanced statistical functions out of the box.
- **Community**: Python has a broader user base, while R's community is highly specialized in statistics and data analysis.

### 2.3. Navigating RStudio Interface

RStudio is an integrated development environment (IDE) for R. It includes a console, syntax-highlighting editor, and tools for plotting, history, debugging, and workspace management. Key areas of the RStudio interface include:

- **Console**: Where R code is executed.
- **Script Editor**: Where you can write and edit R scripts.
- **Environment/History**: Displays your current workspace and command history.
- **Files/Plots/Packages/Help**: A panel for file management, graphical outputs, package management, and documentation.

![Untitled](img/Untitled.png)

There are many ways to store and execute R code, namely: R script (`.R`), R Markdown (`.Rmd`), or R Notebook (which is an `Rmd` file but with extra stuff). For this course, we recommend sticking to R Markdown for ease of use.

### R in VSCode

Alternatively, you may wish to use VSCode for your R development. You can follow the instructions here to set it up on your local machine: 

[](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/languages/r)

### Examples of Basic R Syntax and Operations

- **Variables**: Assign values with **`<-`** or **`=`**. E.g., **`x <- 10`** or **`x = 10`**.
- **Data Types**: Includes vectors, lists, matrices, data frames, and factors.
    - **Vectors**: Basic data structure, created using **`c()`**. E.g., **`v <- c(1, 2, 3)`**.
    - **Data Frames**: Tabular data, similar to Python's Pandas DataFrame.
- **Basic Functions**: Use functions like **`mean()`**, **`sum()`**, **`length()`**.
- **Packages**: Enhance R’s functionality. Install with **`install.packages("package_name")`** and load with **`library(package_name)`**.

### 2.4. Running code in R Markdown

R Markdown works with executable code chunks and markdown text sections. By default the plain text input in the file will be considered markdown input (so you can use markdown notations for formatting). To create an executable chunk in R Markdown, use the ``` symbols with the tag `{r}`   to signify a chunk should be considered a piece of runnable R code. Note that since R is a scripting language, you can run the code line-by-line or by chunk. Run the following chunk and check the output which should be displayed below the chunk in RStudio.

````
```{r}
# c() is for 'concatenate' or 'combine'
# this is essentially 'combining' 4 single-element vectors
# into a vector of 4 integers (R treats values as single-element vectors).
myVector <- c(1,2,3,4)
mean(myVector)
```
````

## 3. Introduction to CRAN and Package Management in R

The Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN) is a repository of R packages. It's the primary resource for extending the capabilities of R. As of my last update, CRAN hosted over 15,000 packages, covering a wide range of functionalities, from data manipulation and statistical modeling to advanced graphics and machine learning.

**Key Points about CRAN:**

- **Centralized Repository**: CRAN provides a centralized place to find and install R packages.
- **Quality Control**: Packages on CRAN are subject to a submission process that includes checks for documentation and compatibility.
- **Ease of Access**: Packages can be easily installed directly from CRAN within the R environment.

### Package Management in R

Managing packages in R involves primarily two functions: **`install.packages()`** for installation and **`library()`** or **`require()`** for loading a package into your R session.

1. **Installing Packages**: Use **`install.packages("package_name")`** to download and install a package from CRAN. This only needs to be done once per package unless updates are released.
2. **Loading Packages**: Once installed, a package can be loaded into your current R session using **`library(package_name)`**. This needs to be done each time you start a new R session and want to use the package.

### Demonstration: Installing ggplot2

`ggplot2` is one of the most popular packages in R for creating complex and beautiful graphics using the grammar of graphics. To install `ggplot2`:

1. Type the following command in your R console:
    
    ```r
    install.packages("ggplot2")
    ```
    
2. R will download and install the `ggplot2` package and its dependencies from CRAN.

### Loading ggplot2 Package

Once ggplot2 is installed, it needs to be loaded into your R session to use it:

1. Type the following command in your R console:
    
    ```r
    library(ggplot2)
    ```
    
2. After this command, `ggplot2` functions will be available in your session.

### Best Practices for Package Management

- **Updating Packages**: Regularly update your packages to get new features and bug fixes. Use **`update.packages()`**.
- **Managing Dependencies**: Some packages depend on others; R automatically handles these dependencies during installation.
- **Version Control**: Sometimes, specific versions of packages are required, especially for reproducibility in projects.

Understanding CRAN and the package management system in R is crucial for extending the functionality of your R environment. With these skills, you are well-equipped to install and load any package, including `ggplot2`, which you will use extensively for data visualization tasks.

## 4. Introduction to the Grammar of Graphics and `ggplot2` Syntax

`ggplot2`, created by Hadley Wickham, is based on the concept of the ***grammar of graphics***. This idea conceptualizes a plot as a coherent system, similar to a language. The grammar of graphics allows for the creation of complex and customizable plots from simple components.

**Key Components of `ggplot2` Grammar:**

- **Data**: The raw data that you want to plot.
- **Aesthetics (`aes`)**: Defines how variables in the data are mapped to visual properties (aesthetics) of the plot such as size, shape, color, x and y axes.
- **Geometries (`geom`)**: The geometric shapes that represent the data (points, lines, bars).
- **Facets**: For creating small multiples.
- **Statistics (`stat`)**: Statistical transformations to perform on the data (e.g., binning, counting, regression).
- **Coordinates**: The system to use for plotting (e.g., Cartesian, polar).
- **Themes**: Visual customizations outside of the data representation (like background color, grid lines).

### Creating a Simple Scatter Plot

A scatter plot is a type of data visualization that uses dots to represent the values obtained for two different variables - one plotted along the x-axis and the other plotted along the y-axis.

**Example: Scatter Plot with mtcars Dataset**

```r
ggplot(data = mtcars, aes(x = wt, y = mpg)) + geom_point()
```

This command creates a scatter plot using the **`mtcars`** dataset, plotting **`wt`** (weight) on the x-axis and **`mpg`** (miles per gallon) on the y-axis.

### Building a Bar Plot with Iris Dataset

Bar plots are useful for displaying the frequency of different categories.

**Example: Bar Plot with Iris Dataset**

```r
ggplot(data = iris, aes(x = Species, fill = Species)) + geom_bar()
```

This command creates a bar plot using the **`iris`** dataset, with different species on the x-axis and the count of each species shown as the height of the bars. The **`fill`** aesthetic is used to color the bars based on the species.

![Untitled](img/Untitled%203.png)

### Customizing Plots

Customizations can enhance the readability and aesthetic appeal of a plot.

- **Adding Titles and Labels**:
    
    ```r
    ggplot(data = mtcars, aes(x = wt, y = mpg)) +
      geom_point() +
      ggtitle("Scatter Plot of mpg vs wt") +
      xlab("Weight") +
      ylab("Miles Per Gallon")
    ```
    
    ![Untitled](img/Untitled%204.png)
    
- **Changing Colors**:
You can change the color of points in a scatter plot, for example:
    
    ```r
    ggplot(data = mtcars, aes(x = wt, y = mpg, color = factor(cyl))) +
      geom_point()
    ```
    
    This command will color the points based on the number of cylinders (**`cyl`**).

### 5.3. Exploring the gapminder Dataset

- **Dataset**: gapminder (install using **`install.packages("gapminder")`** and then **`library(gapminder)`**)
- **Task**: Create a line plot showing GDP per capita over time for select countries.
- **Customization**: Use different line types and colors for each country.
    
    ```r
    ggplot(subset(gapminder, country %in% c("Japan", "United Kingdom", "United States")),
           aes(x = year, y = gdpPercap, color = country, linetype = country)) +
        geom_line() +
        scale_y_log10() +
        ggtitle("GDP Per Capita Over Time") +
        theme_light()
    ```

### 5.4. Working with the diamonds Dataset

- **Dataset**: diamonds (part of ggplot2 package)
- **Task**: Create a histogram of diamond prices, faceted by cut quality.
- **Customization**: Adjust the bin width and use a theme that enhances readability.
    
    ```r
    ggplot(diamonds, aes(x = price)) +
        geom_histogram(binwidth = 500) +
        facet_wrap(~cut) +
        labs(title = "Diamond Prices by Cut Quality", x = "Price", y = "Count") +
        theme_classic()
    ```
    
    ![Untitled](img/Untitled%209.png)
    

### General tips:

- **Explore Different Geoms**: Try **`geom_bar`**, **`geom_line`**, **`geom_histogram`**, **`geom_boxplot`**, etc.
- **Play with Aesthetics**: Experiment with changing colors, shapes, sizes, and alpha transparency.
- **Try Faceting**: Use **`facet_wrap`** or **`facet_grid`** for multi-panel plots.
- **Modify Themes**: Test out various **`theme_`** options like **`theme_minimal`**, **`theme_light`**, **`theme_classic`**.
- **Add Annotations**: Use **`geom_text`** or **`annotate`** for labels and custom text.
