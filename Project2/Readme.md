# COMP4010/5120: Data Visualization - Spring 2025

# Instruction for Project 2

## 1. Project Details

The goal of this project is to apply what you have learnt throughout the semester to solve a very open-ended problem. Students will be assigned in teams, consisting of up to 3 members per team. In this project, your task is to create something related to data visualization. This is a vague prompt and you will find more info in the deliverables section of this document. The project will be completed over the second half of the semester and will account for 30% of your final score.

## 2. Project Timeline

- **Week 1 (21/04 - 27/04):** Meet your team, begin brainstorming ideas for your project; Submit your project proposal.
- **Week 2 (27/04 - 04/05):** Provide peer reviews to two other teams as issues on their GitHub repos. Address issues raised on your teamâ€™s project repo through explicit commits. Start working on coding, presentation, and report. (remember to take a break on 30/04 and 01/05 :D)
- **Week 3 (05/05 - 15/05):** Review feedback from the teaching team on your proposal and continue working on deliverables.
- **Week 4 (16/05 - 30/05):** Finalize your report and presentation, and clean up code files.

## 3. Deadlines

There are four important milestones for this project:

- **27/04:** Submit the first version of the project proposal.
- **04/05:** Complete peer reviews for two other teams.
- **15/05:** Resubmit the revised proposal based on peer reviews and resolve the issues raised.
- **30/05:** Submit the project package, including presentation slides, write-up, and code files.

## 4. Deliverables

### 4.1 Project Questions
One requirement is that your project should feature some element that you had to learn on your own. This could be a package you use that we didnâ€™t teach in class (e.g., a package for building 3D visualizations) or a workflow (e.g., making a package) or anything else. Another requirement is that it cannot be an extension of you Data-Driven Story Project. So need to work on something completely different from that project and project 1. And the last requirement is that your project is built reproducibly in R. Your first task is to come up with a goal for your project. Here are a few ideas to help you get
started thinking:

- Build a Shiny app that that has an Instagram-like user interface for applying filters, except not filters but themes for ggplots.
- Create an R package that provides functionality for a set of ggplot2 themes and/or color palettes
- Build a generative art system.
- Do a deep dive into accessibility for data visualization and build a lesson plan for creating accessible visualizations with ggplot2, Quarto, and generally within the R ecosystem.
- Create an interactive and/or animated spatio-temporal visualization on a topic of interest to you, e.g., redistricting, COVID-19, voter suppression, etc.
- Recreate art pieces with ggplot2.
- Make a data visualization telling a story and convert it to an illustration, presenting both the computational and artistic piece side by side.
- Build a dashboard.
And, of course, your project can be about visualizing a dataset of interest to you (similar to your first project). The only rule about this dataset is that you need to be the one who create the dataset **(through crawling, for example)**. Furthermore, as we have already done this in project 1, if you choose this path and want to get decent score, you should attempt to visualize a very challenging dataset, such as creating visualization for 3+ dimensions, visualize social network, text, etc.. Plotting non-interactive charts and visualize a dataset with bar plot/ pie chart will not give you high score for project 2. 


### 4.2 Details on Deliverables

#### **ðŸ“ŒProposal - Due 27th of April**

Your proposal should include:

1. A one sentence description of your high-level goal (such as the ones listed above).
2. A one to two paragraph description of your goals, including your motivation. Please explain why this project is interesting, what problems can it solve? 

   Depending on the focus of your project, the following might go in here:
      - If answering a particular research question, the question itself and the reason why you chose this question.
      - If you crawl a new dataset and plan to visualize it, explain how you collect the data, why you choose to tackle this problem and any other relevant metadata. 

3. A weekly plan outlining your steps to complete your project and including the team member(s) assigned to that task.
4. A github repo, with all the relevant info about your project

ðŸ‘‰*Expected output* of this phases include:

1. Create a public repository on Github
2. Upload your proposal and data to that repository. Proposal can be a .md file
3. Submit the link to your repository on Canvas by the deadline


#### **ðŸ“ŒPeer Review - Due 04th of May**

Each team will review the proposals of two other teams. We will assign review pairs (see Section 6.3 of this document).

**Review Process:**

- Develop the review as a team.
- One member will submit it as an issue on the reviewed teamâ€™s project repo.
- Title the issue: `Peer review for proposal - [Your group name]`.
- Provide 2-3 constructive suggestions.

ðŸ‘‰*Expected output:*

- Create two issues on the repositories of the teams assigned to you.
- Submit links to the issues on Canvas.

#### **ðŸ“ŒRevised Proposal - Due 15st of May**

After receiving feedback, update your proposal and make necessary revisions.

ðŸ‘‰*Expected output:*

- Commits and comments addressing the issues raised.
- (Optional) Revise your proposal and TAs will give you feedback on the new version, but this task is not graded

#### **ðŸ“ŒWrite-up - Due 30th of May**

Your have a lot more freedom in how you structure your write-up for this project compared to Project 1. This also comes with responsibility. You should make sure you have a clear introduction and a clear conclusion. You should also have other interim section headings that help the reader. Your write-up should be somewhere between 1000 and 2000 words. There is no expectation that you get close to the upper limit, anywhere in that range is fine as long as you have clearly explained yourself. The limits are provided to help you, not to set stressful expectations.

ðŸ‘‰*Expected output* of this phases include:
- Submit your report on canvas in RmD/ Pdf format
- Your code for the project should be well documented and reproducible, i.e. we can retrieve the same output which you present through running your code



#### **ðŸ“ŒPresentation - Slides Due 30th of May, Oral Presentation in the Following Week**

Each team will give an **8-minute presentation**, followed by **Q&A**. The session will last **15 minutes** in total.

ðŸ‘‰*Expected output:*

- Submit slides on Canvas (PDF or PPT format).
- Deliver an in-class presentation with a Q&A session.
