# COMP4010/5120: Data Visualization - Spring 2025

# Instruction for Project 2

## 1. Project Details

The goal of this project is to apply what you have learnt throughout the semester to solve a very open-ended problem. Students will be assigned in teams, consisting of 3 members per team. In this project, your task is to create something related to data visualization. This is a vague prompt and you will find more info in the deliverables section of this document. The project will be completed over the second half of the semester and will account for 30% of your final score.

## 2. Project Timeline

- **Week 1 (17/04 - 27/04):** Meet your team, begin brainstorming ideas for your project; Submit your project proposal.
- **Week 2 (27/04 - 04/05):** Provide peer reviews to two other teams as issues on their GitHub repos. Address issues raised on your team‚Äôs project repo through explicit commits. Start working on coding, presentation, and report. (remember to take a break on 30/04 and 01/05 :D)
- **Week 3 (05/05 - 15/05):** Review feedback from the teaching team on your proposal and continue working on deliverables.
- **Week 4 (16/05 - 30/05):** Finalize your report and presentation, and clean up code files.

## 3. Deadlines

There are four important milestones for this project:

- **27/04:** Submit the first version of the project proposal.
- **04/05:** Complete peer reviews for two other teams.
- **15/05:** Resubmit the revised proposal based on peer reviews and resolve the issues raised.
- **30/05:** Submit the project package, including presentation slides, write-up, and code files.

## 4. Deliverables

### 4.1 Project Questions
One requirement is that your project should feature some element that you had to learn on your own. This could be a package you use that we didn‚Äôt teach in class (e.g., a package for building 3D visualizations) or a workflow (e.g., making a package) or anything else. Another requirement is that it cannot be an extension of you Data-Driven Story Project. So need to work on something completely different from that project and project 1. And the last requirement is that your project is built reproducibly in R. Your first task is to come up with a goal for your project. Here are a few ideas to help you get
started thinking:

- Build a Shiny app that that has an Instagram-like user interface for applying filters, except not filters but themes for ggplots.
- Create an R package that provides functionality for a set of ggplot2 themes and/or color palettes
- Build a generative art system.
- Do a deep dive into accessibility for data visualization and build a lesson plan for creating accessible visualizations with ggplot2, Quarto, and generally within the R ecosystem.
- Create an interactive and/or animated spatio-temporal visualization on a topic of interest to you, e.g., redistricting, COVID-19, voter suppression, etc.
- Recreate art pieces with ggplot2.
- Make a data visualization telling a story and convert it to an illustration, presenting both the computational and artistic piece side by side.
- Build a dashboard.
And, of course, your project can be about visualizing a dataset of interest to you (similar to your first project). The only rule about this dataset is that you need to be the one who create the dataset **(through crawling, for example)**. Furthermore, as we have already done this in project 1, if you choose this path and want to get decent score, you should attempt to visualize a very challenging dataset, such as creating visualization for 3+ dimensions, visualize social network, text, etc.. Plotting non-interactive charts and visualize a dataset with bar plot/ pie chart will not give you high score for project 2. 


### 4.2 Details on Deliverables

4.2 Details on deliverables
Proposal - Due 25th of April


Peer Review - Due 5th of May
Each team will review the proposals of two other teams. We will assign which teams that you
have to write the reviews for (check section 6.3 of this document)
Teams will develop the review together, with discussion among all team members, but only
one team member will submit it as an issue on the project repo. To do so, go to the Issues
tab, click on the green New issue button on the top right.
The title of the issue should be ‚ÄúPeer review for proposal - [Your group name]‚Äù, and you
should point out 2-3 problems or suggestions for your friends to improve their work.
Remember, your goal is to help the team whose project proposal you‚Äôre reviewing. The team
will not lose points because of issues you point out, as long as they address them before I
review their proposals. You should be critical, but respectful in your review. Also remember
that you will be evaluated on the quality of your review. So that‚Äôs an additional incentive to do
a good job.
The expected output of this phases include:
- Create 2 issues on the repositories of each of the 2 teams you are assigned to
review
- Submit links to the issues you have created on your classmates‚Äô repos
Replies to your feedback - Due 12th of May
Once you receive feedback from your peers, you should address them. You should do this
by directly updating your proposal or making any other updates to your repo as needed.
After addressing the feedback, you should also wrap up your updates with a comment,
detailing on how you are going to fix the problems/suggestions made by your friends.
The expected output of this phases include:
- Commits and comments on the repositories to address the issues your peers point
out
- (Optional) Revise your proposal and TAs will give you feedback on the new version,
but this task is not graded
Write-up - Due 2nd of June
Your have a lot more freedom in how you structure your write-up for this project compared to
Project 1. This also comes with responsibility. You should make sure you have a clear
introduction and a clear conclusion. You should also have other interim section headings that
help the reader. Your write-up should be somewhere between 1000 and 2000 words. There
is no expectation that you get close to the upper limit, anywhere in that range is fine as long
as you have clearly explained yourself. The limits are provided to help you, not to set
stressful expectations.
The expected output of this phases include:
- Submit your report on canvas in RmD/ Pdf format
- Your code for the project should be well documented and reproducible, i.e. we can
retrieve the same output which you present through running your code
Presentation - Slides due 2nd of June, Oral Presentation due the following week
Each team will give a 12-minute presentation, followed by Q&A. We expect each
presentation + Q&A will last within 20 minutes.
And of course, this presentation should include a demo of your product if you are building
dashboard, package, etc.
The expected output of this phases include:
- Submit your slides on canvas (pdf or ppt)
- In-class presentation followed by Q&As
Group contribution form - Due 2nd of June
Follow this template, submit a copy of your team contribution on Canvas. Your individual
score will be weighted based on this document.
